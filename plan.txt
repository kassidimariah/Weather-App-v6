Plan for this week: 
1. Add the CSS and HTML for the forecast
    a. Where should the new data go, exactly? 
    b. Insert a new container class
    c. Within the container, insert rows
    d. Within the rows, insert columns 
2. Add the API call to get the future forecast. Will need to use another API for future predictions. 
3. Replace the fake data with real time data from new API.
